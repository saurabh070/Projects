        "1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF BOUNDS\"\n",
        "2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is\n",
        " * within 10 of the number, return \"WARM!\"\n",
        " * further than 10 away from the number, return \"COLD!\"\n",
        "3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is\n",

        " * farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"COLDER!\"\n",
