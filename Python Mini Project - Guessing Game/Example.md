Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

Here's how to play:

1. The computer has picked a random number between 1 and 100.
2. Your task is to guess the correct number.
3. If your guess is too low or too high (less than 1 or more than 100), you'll be told "OUT OF BOUNDS."
4. On your first turn:
   - If your guess is within 10 of the number, you'll be told "WARM!"
   - If your guess is more than 10 away, you'll be told "COLD!"
5. On subsequent turns:
   - If your new guess is closer than the previous one, you'll be told "WARMER!"
   - If your new guess is farther, you'll be told "COLDER!"
6. Keep guessing until you get the correct number!
7. Once you guess correctly, you'll be informed, and the game will tell you how many guesses it took.

Now, let the guessing begin! Good luck!
